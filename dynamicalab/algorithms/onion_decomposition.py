def onion_decomposition(graph):
    """This function extracts the onion decomposition and the k-core decomposition of a simple undirected graph. 
      

      **Parameters**
      
    
      graph : nx.Graph
          The simple undirected graph without self-loops.
      

      **Retuns**


      onion : dict
          Dictionary mapping the vertices (identified by their name) to their layer in the onion decomposition.

      kcore : dict
          Dictionary mapping the vertices (identified by their name) to the maximal k-core to which they belong.
