This paper characterizes the floral biology and pollination spectrum of the "morichal" community, and tests whether pollination systems and unspecialized pollen transpotation are in accord with the high proportion of self-compatibility found in the "morichal." (The "morichal" is a tropical swamp community dominated by Mauritia flexuosa.)',
