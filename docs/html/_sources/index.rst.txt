DynamicaLab documentation
=======================================

`Dynamicalab` is a python package to help doing network science. We regroup here some of our hacks to existing librairies like `Networkx <https://networkx.github.io/>`_.

This project is an initiative of `Dynamica research group <http://dynamica.phy.ulaval.ca>`_, based at Universit√© Laval. This is not the homepage of the research group.
