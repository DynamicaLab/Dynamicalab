Installation
-----------------

Installing ``DynamicaLab`` is easy (compared to some existing graph librairies). Clone the repository `DynamicaLab <https://github.com/DynamicaUL/Dynamica-lab>`_. 
Then, install the module:


.. code:: bash

	python setup.py install


You can now test:

.. code:: python
	
	import dynamicalab as dlab
